In this Project, I embark on an exploration of predictive modeling to unravel the complexities of English Premier league outcomes. By diving deep into historical match data spanning multiple seasons, I crafted a robust model that merges various team performance metrics and match statistics to forecast each teamâ€™s final points and ultimately predict the league champion. The journey began with meticulous feature engineering, trans- forming raw data into meaningful insights that could fuel predictive accuracy. This foundation set the stage for the deployment of three powerful machine learning models: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest Classi- fier. Each model was rigorously tested and validated using key performance metrics, with a spotlight on accuracy to ensure precision in predicting final points and league winners. Among the models, the Random Forest Clas- sifier emerged as the standout performer, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 95. This model consistently demonstrated its prowess by accurately forecasting the final points and pinpointing the league champion. These re- sults not only underscore the potential of machine learning in sports analytics but also provide valuable tools for football clubs, analysts, and enthusiasts aiming to gain a competitive edge in predicting league outcomes.
